# Waddup Nerd
This is my own personal repo just to keep track of things. Don't expect quality or effort.

## JankyBorders (pretty coloured borders)
Location: `~/.config/borders`

## NeoFetch
Just inject the ASCII art directly into your `neofetch.sh` for your respective OS

Location: `/opt/homebrew/bin/`

## Aerospace (tiling window manager)
Location: `~/.aerospace.toml`

After configuring aerospace, you may notice `Mission Control` (three finger swipe up) shows very small windows. To fix this go into `Settings > Desktop & Dock > Mission Control` and set `Group windows by application` to `On`.

Main changes:
- Moved float hotkey to main mode and set to `alt-shift-f`
- changed move and focus direction keys from `hjkl` to `ijkl` because gaymers > vim
- removed all lettered workspace hotkeys, kept 1-10; to avoid weird conflicts with hotkeys.

## Oh My Posh
Location: `/opt/homebrew/opt/oh-my-posh/themes`

Started with `catppuccin_mocha` theme. Added date and time for more detailed screenshots, differentiated colour between date, user/host, and path for people with bad eyes (me). Put prompt on new line because it looks better, fight me. Removed git status segment, may put it back later.

Can change `"style": "agnoster_short"` in the path segment to `"style": "full"` if you dont want a truncated path.
