## NeoFetch
Just inject the ASCII art directly into your neofetch.sh for your respective OS

`/opt/homebrew/bin/`

## Aerospace (tiling window manager)
`~/.aerospace.toml`

Main changes:
- Moved float hotkey to main mode and set to alt-shift-f
- changed move and focus direction keys from hjkl to ijkl because gaymers > vim
- removed all lettered workspace hotkeys, kept 1-10; to avoid weird conflicts with hotkeys.

## Oh My Posh
`/opt/homebrew/opt/oh-my-posh/themes`

Added date and time for more detailed screenshots, differentiated colour between date, user/host, and path for people with bad eyes (me). Put prompt on new line because it looks better, fight me.

Can change `"style": "agnoster_short"` in the path segment to `"style": "full"` if you dont want a truncated path.
